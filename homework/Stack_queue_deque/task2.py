# this function searches through the entire list/string that we gave as argument;
# is looks only for different types of parentheses, not digits/letters (from the 2 lists above);
# it appends the open parentheses to our stack, so that they can easily be popped.
# if it finds an element from the close_symbols list, it searches for the corresponding match (the specific open symbol)
# and if they don't match, we simply return "Unbalanced" statement. If we go through the entire process, and we don't
# obtain an empty stack, it means that some symbol didn't have a corresponding pair, and we also return "Unbalanced"
