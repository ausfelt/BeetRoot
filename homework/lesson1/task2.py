# Create a python program named “task2”, and use the built-in function `print` in it several times.
# to pass “sep”, “end” params and pass several parameters separated by commas.
# Also, provide a comment text above each print statement,
# mentioned above, with the expected output after execution of the particular print statement.


a = "Hello"

# Hello there
